I gave a talk at Kafka Summit NYC on May 8th, 2017.

> **Microservices with Kafka: An Introduction to Kafka Streams with a Real-Life Example**
> 
> On our project, we built a great system to analyze customer records in real time. We pioneered a microservices architecture using Spark and Kafka and we had to tackle many technical challenges. In this session, I will show how Kafka Streams provided a great replacement to Spark Streaming and I will explain how to use this great library to implement low latency data pipelines.
